Explaination of the Testing script:
Our method of testing our code was a batch file which applies all of the input files we have created to the code and generates resulting DTF and output files. The input files are organized by function and the resulting files are placed in the same directory and compared to the expected DTF and output files. If the two sets of DTF and output files do not match, the test fails.
